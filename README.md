| Projects       | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **Loan delinquency prediction, Crescent bank competition, Python, Second place winner**  | Framed the business problem, identified delinquent customers, predicted default rate with 81 percent accuracy, using gradient boosting, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, stacking, and automated the preparation and scoring function |
| **Machine Learning Explainability - IBM Employee Attrition** | If I wanted to summarise machine learning expandability in one line, it would be "contemplating whether the model is behaving as expected". In this very long notebook I go over a series of machine learning expandability algorithms to investigate how we can take alook inside black box models. The project is based mainly on the book ["Interpretable Machine Learning - A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable"](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar. I also have included some other useful links that I have found over internet. |
| **Retail sales multivatiate time series prediction** |  Predicted sales for 214,000 target items in 42 stores, with limited historical data <br /> Analyzed univariate and multivariate time series, decomposed trends and seasonal components using statsmodels
Used a combination of Auto ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Gradient Boosting to predict future sales based on past data distributions |
| **Predicting loans awarded to small businesses** |Built functions to automatically clean, impute, and transform data, and predicted if loans were awarded using LightGBM |
| **Fraud Detection** | Highly unbalenced dataset, Ongoing Project|
