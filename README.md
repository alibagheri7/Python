| Projects       | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| **Loan delinquency prediction, Crescent bank competition, Python, Second place winner**  | Framed the business problem, identified delinquent customers, predicted default rate with 81 percent accuracy <br /> - Used gradient boosting, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, stacking, and automated the preparation and scoring function |
| **[Machine Learning Explainability - IBM Employee Attrition](https://nbviewer.org/github/alibagheri7/Python_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/ML_Explainability/IBM_Employee_Attrition.ipynb)** | - If I wanted to summarise machine learning expandability in one line, it would be "contemplating whether the model is behaving as expected". <br /> - In this very long notebook I go over a series of machine learning expandability algorithms to investigate how we can take a look inside the black box models, study feature importance, inspect model behavior and perform error analysis. <br /> - The project is based mainly on the book ["Interpretable Machine Learning - A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable"](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar. <br /> - The dataset is from kaggle and I investigate the effect of features on a variety of models and analyze their effect on error. |
| **[Retail sales multivatiate time series prediction](https://github.com/alibagheri7/Python_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/TimeSeries_MultiVariate_Sales_Prediction/Multivariate%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20with%20Gradient%20Boosting%20and%20SARIMAX.ipynb)** |  - Predicted sales for 214,000 target items in 42 stores, with limited historical data <br /> - Analyzed univariate and multivariate time series, decomposed trends and seasonal components using statsmodels <br /> - Used a combination of Auto ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Gradient Boosting to predict future sales based on past data distributions |
| **Predicting loans awarded to small businesses** |Built functions to automatically clean, impute, and transform data, and predicted if loans were awarded using LightGBM |
| **[Fraud Detection](https://nbviewer.org/github/alibagheri7/Python_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Fraud_Detection/Fraud.ipynb)** <br /> (almost finished) | Used an ensemble of over and undersampling and anomoly detection learning methods for a highly imbalanced dataset (0.17 %ratio)|
| **[Texas Inflation Prediction](https://github.com/alibagheri7/Python_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Texas_Yearly_Inflation_prediction/Texas_Inflation.ipynb)** <br /> (ongoing) | - Predicted Texas' next year's inflation using a varity of predictive models <br /> -  Used sktime and skforecast for data manipultion, and model cross validation <br /> - Used detrending, gradient boosting and exogenous variables to improve the naive base forecaster by 50 percent|
